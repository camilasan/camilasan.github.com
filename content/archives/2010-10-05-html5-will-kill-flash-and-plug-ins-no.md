title: '"HTML5 Will Kill Flash and Plug-Ins" - No!'


<p>I will say it over and over again. And I read about it again in <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/09/23/html5-the-facts-and-the-myths/" target="_blank">this very good article</a> of  <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com" target="_blank">Smashing Magazine</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>But not all of Flash’s use cases are usurped by HTML5. There is no way to do digital rights management in HTML5; browsers such as Opera, Firefox and Chrome allow visitors to save video to their machines with a click of the context menu. If you need to prevent video from being saved, you’ll need to use plug-ins.</em></p>
