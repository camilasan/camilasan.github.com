title: The future is coming on.


<p>Well, after being robbed in the beginning of the semester, I think I'm ending this time in a great way, cause...</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a title="Akademy 2010" rel="http://akademy.kde.org" href="http://akademy.kde.org" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-136" title="Akademy 2010" src="assets/akademy2010.png" alt="Akademy 2010" width="380" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>In two days I'm going to cross the ocean and meet all that people that I've used to read the blogs and talk in IM. Me and Amanda (<strong>KDE-MG</strong> and KDE Lovelace), are going to talk about the Women in KDE and <a title="KDE Lovelace" href="http://kdelovelace.wordpress.com/" target="_blank"><strong>KDE Lovelace</strong></a>, with others girls, like Lydia (<strong>Amarok</strong>) and Anne Marie (<strong>KDE - Edu</strong>) and Seele (<strong>KDE - Ev</strong>,  <strong>KDE - Usability</strong>).</p>
<p>I am looking forward for this meeting to exchange experiences and learn more and more with all the crowd that are making the KDE getting better every day.</p>
<p>In these 10 days I'm planning also to get up to date in the new <strong>Qt </strong>technologies that are popping up like QML, while being there at Akademy, I will be blogging here and in the KDE-Lovelace blog, and in july, in the <strong>FISL (International Forum on Free Software)</strong> me and Amanda (again!) will be talking about our experience with free software, about the <strong>news from Akademy</strong> and how the women have been working for KDE and how can you do that too!</p>,-
