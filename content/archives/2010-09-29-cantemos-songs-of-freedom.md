<p>Redemption Song - Bob Marley :D</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Old pirates, yes, they rob I,<br />
Sold I to the merchant ships,<br />
Minutes after they took I<br />
From the bottom less pit<br />
But my hand was made strong<br />
By the hand of the Almighty<br />
We forward in this generation<br />
Triumphantly</em></p>
<p><em>Won't you help to sing,<br />
These songs of freedom?<br />
'Cause all I ever have:<br />
Redemption songs,<br />
Redemption songs!</em></p>
<p><em>Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery<br />
None but ourselves can free our minds<br />
Have no fear for atomic energy,<br />
'Cause none of them can stop the time<br />
How long shall they kill our prophets,<br />
While we stand aside and look<br />
Huh, some say it's just a part of it:<br />
We've got to ful fill the Book</em></p>
<p><em>Won't you help to sing,<br />
These songs of freedom?<br />
'Cause all I ever have:<br />
Redemption songs,<br />
Redemption songs,<br />
Redemption songs!</em></p>
<p><em>Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery<br />
None but ourselves can free our mind<br />
Oh, have no fear for atomic energy,<br />
'Cause none of them-a can-a stop-a-the time<br />
How long shall they kill our prophets,<br />
While we stand aside and look?<br />
Yes, some say it's just a part of it:<br />
We've got to ful fill the Book</em></p>
<p><em>Won't you help to sing,<br />
These songs of freedom?<br />
'Cause all I ever had:<br />
Redemption songs,<br />
All I ever had:<br />
Redemption songs!<br />
These songs of freedom,<br />
Songs of freedom!</em></p></blockquote>
