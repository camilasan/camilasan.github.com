title: The longest semester I've ever had.


<p>After a loooong semester...with very good news and very bad news too, I think I survived (again), and here I am to try to tell you in a few words what I've been doing.</p>
<p>In november, KDE Brazil was present at <a title="Latinoware" href="http://latinoware.org/" target="_blank">VII Latino American Conference of Free Software</a>, where I gave a talk: "<a title="PDF" href="http://kders.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/okdeprecisadevoce.pdf" target="_blank">KDE needs you: how to start to contribute</a>" - you can see pictures <a title="KDE at Latinoware 2010" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kdebr/sets/72157625335589745/" target="_blank">here</a>.  Just a few days before Latinoware started, in some KDE e-mail lists I asked for specific suggestions where the people can start to help. And some people suggested intersting links for newbies to check out and pick something to do for KDE:</p>
<p><a title="Bugs" href="https://bugs.kde.org/weekly-bug-summary.cgi" target="_blank">https://bugs.kde.org/weekly-bug-summary.cgi</a><br />
<a title="Important work to be done" href="http://techbase.kde.org/Contribute/ImportantWorkToBeDone" target="_blank">http://techbase.kde.org/Contribute/ImportantWorkToBeDone</a></p>
<p>Besides that, <a title="KDE-Lovelace" href="http://kdelovelace.wordpress.com" target="_blank">Aracele and me</a> are putting some efforts into translation <a title="Techbase" href="http://techbase.kde.org/" target="_blank">KDE Techbase</a> and <a title="User Base" href="http://userbase.kde.org/" target="_blank">Userbase</a> into Portuguese. So we already translated some pages, but still there is a lot of work...so If you speak portuguese, know english, and want to improve your knowledges of english and KDE, you're welcome to help us! That's a good way to start to contribute =)</p>
<p>And <a title="Page Preview Plugin" href="http://code.google.com/p/pagepreviewplugin/" target="_blank">code</a>? With the <a title="Millian Wolf" href="http://milianw.de" target="_blank">Millian</a>'s help I also fixed some bugs in <a title="Page Preview Plugin" href="http://kders.wordpress.com/2010/09/29/on-the-fly-preview-on-quanta-also-my-first-real-code-for-kde/" target="_blank">my plugin for Quanta</a> and I just implemented a few features, as you can see in the screencast below:</p>

title: The longest semester I've ever had.


<p>After a loooong semester...with very good news and very bad news too, I think I survived (again), and here I am to try to tell you in a few words what I've been doing.</p>
<p>In november, KDE Brazil was present at <a title="Latinoware" href="http://latinoware.org/" target="_blank">VII Latino American Conference of Free Software</a>, where I gave a talk: "<a title="PDF" href="http://kders.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/okdeprecisadevoce.pdf" target="_blank">KDE needs you: how to start to contribute</a>" - you can see pictures <a title="KDE at Latinoware 2010" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kdebr/sets/72157625335589745/" target="_blank">here</a>.  Just a few days before Latinoware started, in some KDE e-mail lists I asked for specific suggestions where the people can start to help. And some people suggested intersting links for newbies to check out and pick something to do for KDE:</p>
<p><a title="Bugs" href="https://bugs.kde.org/weekly-bug-summary.cgi" target="_blank">https://bugs.kde.org/weekly-bug-summary.cgi</a><br />
<a title="Important work to be done" href="http://techbase.kde.org/Contribute/ImportantWorkToBeDone" target="_blank">http://techbase.kde.org/Contribute/ImportantWorkToBeDone</a></p>
<p>Besides that, <a title="KDE-Lovelace" href="http://kdelovelace.wordpress.com" target="_blank">Aracele and me</a> are putting some efforts into translation <a title="Techbase" href="http://techbase.kde.org/" target="_blank">KDE Techbase</a> and <a title="User Base" href="http://userbase.kde.org/" target="_blank">Userbase</a> into Portuguese. So we already translated some pages, but still there is a lot of work...so If you speak portuguese, know english, and want to improve your knowledges of english and KDE, you're welcome to help us! That's a good way to start to contribute =)</p>
<p>And <a title="Page Preview Plugin" href="http://code.google.com/p/pagepreviewplugin/" target="_blank">code</a>? With the <a title="Millian Wolf" href="http://milianw.de" target="_blank">Millian</a>'s help I also fixed some bugs in <a title="Page Preview Plugin" href="http://kders.wordpress.com/2010/09/29/on-the-fly-preview-on-quanta-also-my-first-real-code-for-kde/" target="_blank">my plugin for Quanta</a> and I just implemented a few features, as you can see in the screencast below:</p>

<p>And the people here in <a title="FLISOl at Porto Alegre" href="http://flisol.net/FLISOL2011/Brasil/PortoAlegre" target="_blank">Porto Alegre</a> are already organizing the <a title="FLISOL 2011" href="http://flisol.net/FLISOL2011" target="_blank">FLISOL 2011</a> (Latino American Festival of Free Software Installation), which I am involved with. I'm making plans for a talk. and making plans for a talk. So if you are near here and want to help or to give a talk, <a title="Contact us" href="http://flisol.net/FLISOL2011/Coordinadores" target="_blank">contact us</a> or <a title="How to join city" href="http://flisol.net/FLISOL2011/Brasil/HowToJoinCity" target="_blank">you can also organize a FLISOL in your city</a> ;)</p>
