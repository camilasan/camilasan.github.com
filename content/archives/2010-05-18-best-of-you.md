title: Best of You

<p>Eu tinha me prometido não fazer isso, assim como não ficar twittando letras de músicas, mas enfim, as vezes, em certos momentos, a gente se identifca com o que elas dizem, então é mais fácil usar das palavras de outros para expressar o que estamos sentindo. Além de que eu adoro Foo Fighters :)</p>
<p>Então, aí vai:</p>
<p><strong>Best of You (Foo Fighters)</strong></p>
<p>I've got another confession to make<br />
I'm your fool<br />
Everyone's got their chains to break<br />
Holding you<br />
Were you born to resist?<br />
Or be abused?</p>
<p>Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?<br />
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?</p>
<p>Or are you gone and on to someone new?<br />
I needed somewhere to hang my head<br />
Without your noose<br />
You gave me something that I didn't have<br />
But had no use<br />
I was too weak to give in<br />
Too strong to lose<br />
My heart is under arrest again<br />
But I'll break loose<br />
My head is giving me life or death<br />
But I can't choose<br />
I swear I'll never give in<br />
I refuse</p>
<p>Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?<br />
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?</p>
<p>Has someone taken your faith?<br />
It's real, the pain you feel<br />
Your trust?<br />
You must confess<br />
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?</p>
<p>Oh...</p>
<p>Has someone taken your faith?<br />
It's real, the pain you feel<br />
The life, the love you'd die to heal<br />
The hope that starts the broken heart<br />
Your trust?<br />
You must confess</p>
<p>Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?<br />
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?</p>
<p>I've got a another confession, my friend<br />
I'm no fool<br />
I'm getting tired of starting again<br />
Somewhere new<br />
Were you born to resist or be abused?<br />
I swear I'll never give in<br />
I refuse</p>
<p>Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?<br />
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?</p>
<p>Has someone taken your faith?<br />
It's real, the pain you feel<br />
Your trust?<br />
You must confess<br />
