<blockquote><p>Seeing plus-size bodies in fashion spreads and ads should be as common as seeing anything else.</p>
<p>'So much of advertising and fashion portrays only one kind of body, and that's super tall and super skinny. I think not only should there be more plus-sized models in fashion, there should also be more petite, pregnant, ethnic, etc.</p>
<p>'I think ever woman should be represented equally  <strong>we're all beautiful in our own ways</strong>!'</p></blockquote>
