title: Umbrello in GSoC - just  a quick update


<h2>What did I do?</h2>
<p>I was working on the view (UMLView) and in the scene (UMLScene) and I tried to separate the methods between two classes, one only to handle the events in the scene (UMLScene) and another to handle the diagrams (Diagram). That's what you can see in the repository now:<br />
<a href="http://websvn.kde.org/branches/work/soc-umbrello-2011/" target="_blank">http://websvn.kde.org/branches/work/soc-umbrello-2011/</a></p>
<p>And untill now I am trying to reuse the code from the first try to port Umbrello.</p>
<h2>What am I doing now?</h2>
<p>To test the "new view" and the "new scene" I need the widgets. So I am working on the UMLWidget and the WidgetBase.</p>
<h2>The next weeks:</h2>,-
