title: If you are at first lonely, be patient.


<p>While I was giving a time to my studies of Qt, I found this text in a <a href="http://edgelista.tumblr.com" target="_blank">tumblr</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Just when I think I have learned the way to live, life  changes and I am  left the same as I began. The more things change the  more I am the  same. It appears that my life is a constant irony of  maturity and  regression, but my sense of progress is based on the  illusion that  things out there are going to remain the same and that,  at last, I have  gained a little control. But there will never be means  to ends, only  means. And I am means. I am what I started with, and when  it is all over  I will be all that is left of me."</p>
<p>- Hugh Prather, in Notes to Myself</p></blockquote>
<p>That's so true.</p>
<p>And this video just say everything:</p>,-
