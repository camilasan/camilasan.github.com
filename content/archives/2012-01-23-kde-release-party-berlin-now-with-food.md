title: KDE Release Party @Berlin, now With Food™


<p>Jos and I are finishing our new house and we would like to invite you to a KDE 4.8 Release + Housewarming Party incl Food™ in our brand new place in Berlin :D</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Next Saturday, day 28 of January.<br />
<strong>Time:</strong> Start at 17h.<br />
<strong>Where:</strong> <em>Eldenaer Straße 28A</em>, an easy walk away from S/U-bahn station Frankfurther Alee:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=52.5202715&amp;amp;lon=13.4692425&amp;amp;zoom=17&amp;amp;layers=M&amp;amp;mlat=52.52022&amp;amp;mlon=13.46925"><img class="size-full wp-image-559 alignnone" title="address" alt="" src="assets/address.png" width="438" height="366" /></a></p>
<p>And for those who prefer it <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;source=s_d&amp;saddr=Eldenaer+Stra%C3%9Fe+28A,+10247,+Friedrichshain,+Berlin,+Deutschland&amp;daddr=&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;aq=0&amp;oq=Eldenaer+Strass+28A,+10247,+Friedrichshain,+Berlin,+Deutschland&amp;sll=52.5202,13.46924&amp;sspn=0.010484,0.027874&amp;vpsrc=0&amp;mra=ls&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=m&amp;ll=52.5202,13.46924&amp;spn=0.010484,0.027874&amp;output=embed&amp;w=425&amp;h=350">a Google maps link</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Who can come: </strong>anyone who can claim a passing relationship to either KDE, openSUSE, Jos or me is more than welcome. Having read this blog counts...<br />
<strong>What to bring:</strong> We'd appreciate it if you bring a happy disposition as well as as well as <em>something to drink and possibly snack</em>.<br />
<strong>What will happen:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>First, we'll welcome-hug you. Sorry, but there's no way around it.</li>
<li>Second, you'll get fed. Jos will unleash his cooking mania in the kitchen. Be aware: some of you will be put to work, either cooking or cleaning. The food will be vegan. Probably curry-like but no promises.</li>
<li>The plan is to then all indulge ourselves on a variety of liquids - depends on what you bring, but we'll have some real Brazilian caipirinha too. If you don't want to carry anything, there's a Lidl on the other side of the street and a 24h shop downstairs ;-)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What to do to be there:</strong> comment below and/or sign up on the <a href="http://community.kde.org/Promo/Events/Release_Parties/4.8#Berlin">release party page</a>. And put it in your agenda...</p>
<p>Love,<br />,-

<p><strong>Who can come: </strong>anyone who can claim a passing relationship to either KDE, openSUSE, Jos or me is more than welcome. Having read this blog counts...<br />
<strong>What to bring:</strong> We'd appreciate it if you bring a happy disposition as well as as well as <em>something to drink and possibly snack</em>.<br />
<strong>What will happen:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>First, we'll welcome-hug you. Sorry, but there's no way around it.</li>
<li>Second, you'll get fed. Jos will unleash his cooking mania in the kitchen. Be aware: some of you will be put to work, either cooking or cleaning. The food will be vegan. Probably curry-like but no promises.</li>
<li>The plan is to then all indulge ourselves on a variety of liquids - depends on what you bring, but we'll have some real Brazilian caipirinha too. If you don't want to carry anything, there's a Lidl on the other side of the street and a 24h shop downstairs ;-)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What to do to be there:</strong> comment below and/or sign up on the <a href="http://community.kde.org/Promo/Events/Release_Parties/4.8#Berlin">release party page</a>. And put it in your agenda...</p>
<p>Love,<br />
