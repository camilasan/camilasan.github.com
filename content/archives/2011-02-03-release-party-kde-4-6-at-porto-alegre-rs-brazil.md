title: Release Party KDE 4.6 at Porto Alegre - RS - Brazil


<p>We met day 26 of January, the day of the release in Pinguim Bar at Porto Alegre.</p>
<p>You can see pictures on <a title="KDE no Pinguim" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kdebr/sets/72157625927523654/with/5396964194/" target="_blank">KDE-BR flickr</a>:</p>

<p>KDE at Pinguim :)</p>
<p>It was pretty cool, I met personally who I knew only by email. We talked, exchanged some ideas, talked about KDE (and I realized that some people still compares KDE 3 to 4), about <a title="Planet pt-br" href="http://planetkde.org/pt-br/" target="_blank">our Planet in Portuguese</a>, Qt and random subjects.</p>
<p>There were people from various places: Érico, from Bagé (the other side from Rio Grande do Sul), Pedro from Natal, Rio Grande do Norte, Julia, from Salvador, Bahia, which is already producing artwork for KDE-BR. There was only one person from Porto Alegre, the rest is "migrant" or are thinking about "migrate" to POA:) And there are users and those who want to start collaborating with KDE and/or resume old projects, like Huberto :D</p>,-

<p>The good thing is that more people attended than the last Release Party, a few months ago. I hope to meet more new users/contributors in the next release ;)</p>,-
