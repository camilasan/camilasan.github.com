<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I know I've been away, for personal reasons, but KDE's always there, on my machine.<br />
It was through this community that I met <a href="http://liveblue.wordpress.com" target="_blank">great friends</a>, <a href="http://kdepi.wordpress.com" target="_blank">here</a> e and <a href="http://blog.lydiapintscher.de/2011/08/16/desktop-summit-recap/" target="_blank">around the world</a>...e <a href="http://blog.jospoortvliet.com" target="_blank">the love of my life</a>.</p>
<p>That's where I learned to hug who I had never seen before, it was where I <a href="http://ungethym.blogspot.com/search/label/community-building" target="_blank">learned to speak English</a>, was <a href="http://kders.wordpress.com/2010/09/29/on-the-fly-preview-on-quanta-also-my-first-real-code-for-kde/" target="_blank">where I learned to program</a> and that's where I found many <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQgvyTomW7Y" target="_blank">elegant, beautiful and sincere people</a>.</p>
<p>Congratulations KDE!!  <a href="http://kders.wordpress.com/2011/05/09/umbrello-in-gsoc/" target="_blank">Thanks</a> <a href="http://jriddell.org/" target="_blank">for everything</a>!</p>,-
