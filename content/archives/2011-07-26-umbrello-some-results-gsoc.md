<p>Hi Folk!</p>
<p>Here I am, after a while discovering that to work from home is not to everyone, that below your pillow you can find a engagement ring ( = and wondering why QMenu::popup needs receives like parameter type a QPoint instead of QPointF (Is it only in my silly mind that QPointF would make more sense? Am I forgetting something about Qt? Considering that QGraphicsView works with real coordinates).</p>
<p>I am working now in the widgets, so for now, you can see the BoxWidget and the ListPopUpMenu in the "new canvas", bellow to the "old canvas".</p>

The video is not so good...so please, check out the repository: <a href="http://websvn.kde.org/branches/work/soc-umbrello-2011/" target="_blank">http://websvn.kde.org/branches/work/soc-umbrello-2011/</a></p>
<p>After the evaluation time, my mentor, Jonathan Riddell, and I decided to use skype to improve our interaction :-) and my work.</p>
<p>And with this, my list-to-do just increases:</p>
<p>- make popup menu work<br />, implement drawing other types of widgets on class diagrams: boxwidget, class, interface..<br />, mouse press event<br />, drag and drop events</p>
