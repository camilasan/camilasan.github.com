title: If You Must Think About Your Weight, Here Are 10 Things to Think

<h2>If You Must Think About Your Weight, Here Are 10 Things to Think</h2>
<blockquote><p><strong>Why do I care?</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>Seriously, why DO you care? <strong>Are you paid to care?</strong> By that I mean, are you in a sexist, lookist industry where it behooves you to maintain a certain weight and <a href="http://jezebel.com/zoe-saldana-totally-fine-with-her-weight-being-on-the-c-507400425">be excited</a> when <em>Allure </em>broadcasts that you only weigh 115 pounds? If so, are you able to separate that from your own personal feelings of self-worth? Do you still feel like a worthwhile person when you are not a perfect size -.5 or whatever that is?</p>
<p><strong>What exactly is going to happen when I reach magical X pounds?</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>Ask yourself <strong>when you felt your best</strong>. Was it really when you weighed 135 pounds? Or was it when you were the most validated about your looks? Consider that your nostalgia for a past existence and the positive attention it brought you might <strong>have been more about the confidence you projected than a number</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Remind yourself of what real human beauty is again.</strong></p>
<p>If all else fails, just get out of your head. Look around and ask yourself what moves you about the human form, historically, contemporarily, artistically. Remind yourself that <strong>bodies in all shapes and sizes of all ages are interesting, unique, strong, useful</strong>.</p></blockquote>
