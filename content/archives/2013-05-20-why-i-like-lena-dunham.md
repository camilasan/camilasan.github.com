title: Why I like Lena Dunham.


<h2>"I ate cake for breakfast...I ate cake for dinner"</h2>
<blockquote><p>
"Meeting actresses who such a big part of their job is about what they look like, I feel so lucky to be freed from that prison. I ate cake for breakfast on the day of the Emmys I ate cake for dinner, my workout didn't require Spanx, and I still feel like I looked better than people expected me to. It was amazing..."

<h2>Other point of view:</h2>
<blockquote><p>"Lena Dunham is not a rape victim, she is a writer-actor-director who is exceptionally well compensated both financially and in the artist’s capital of choice — attention — for exploiting her body as an artistic commodity. This is wholly deserved: Dunham is one of the medium’s most gifted artists working at her full potential. However, calling this brave as opposed to a calculated risk — the ideal impact of which is the exact debate that it has caused — is paternalistic, condescending, and intellectually dishonest. Writers are narcissists: They presume that their personal obsessions and neuroses are of deep fascination — or even <i>beneficial </i>— to potentially millions of people."</p></blockquote>
