title: '[GSoC] Umbrello: Merging soc branch and trunk.'


<p>Hi!</p>
<p>After my last talk with my mentor, we decided that would be better to merge what I've doing until now in the trunk instead of to wait until the end of the project - that would be so much more work (even now, have been hard to get the new merged branch compiling and working). So for this, I made a branch from the trunk wich I am merging with the <a href="http://websvn.kde.org/branches/work/soc-umbrello-2011/" target="_blank">soc-umbrello-2011 branch</a>.</p>
<p>The merge result (untill now) you can check here: <a href="http://websvn.kde.org/branches/work/umbrello-qgv-port/" target="_blank">http://websvn.kde.org/branches/work/umbrello-qgv-port/</a>.</p>
<p>The idea is: if any change will be  done in the trunk, need to be done in the new branch as well.</p>
<p>Bye. Cya at Desktop Summit =)</p>
